## Usage

```rust
let mut labels = LabelMap::new();
labels.insert("test", "test");
labels.insert("test1", "test");
let result = parse("test = test, test1 in (test)", &labels);
```

## Feedback and Contributions

Both very welcome. This is my first public crate and I am just starting to learn rust. So non-idiomatic rust
and beginner mistakes are to be expected in the code base. Please provide feedback and contributions so
I can fix it :).
